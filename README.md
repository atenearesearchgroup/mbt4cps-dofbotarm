# mbt4cps-dofbotarm

For the replication of this proyect we can find everything related to the Dofbot robotic arm in the [Dofbot](https://github.com/atenearesearchgroup/mbt4cps-dofbotarm/tree/main/Dofbot) section.

Here we can find 3 sections corresponding to:

- [UModel](https://github.com/atenearesearchgroup/mbt4cps-dofbotarm/tree/main/Dofbot/UModel): The diagrams used to generate the executables with Altova UModel.
- [dotnet-mcp](https://github.com/atenearesearchgroup/mbt4cps-dofbotarm/tree/main/Dofbot/dotnet-mcp): The project with the executable to use in the Raspberry Pi of the arm.
- [Dofbot_Arm](https://github.com/atenearesearchgroup/mbt4cps-dofbotarm/tree/main/Dofbot/Dofbot_Arm): All the low level code and libraries to make the arm connect with the Altova project and its executable files.


## Tool for the generation of tests by the user

In the section [UserTest](https://github.com/atenearesearchgroup/mbt4cps-dofbotarm/tree/main/UserTest) we can find a folder containing all the necessary files to include in a Java project in Eclipse for the use or modification of the tool for the generation of tests by the user.

Also it is include a tutorial video and a manual of how to install everything and create or use this tool.

## Tool for the generation of unitary tests

In the section [UnitaryTest](https://github.com/atenearesearchgroup/mbt4cps-dofbotarm/tree/main/UnitaryTest) we can find a folder containing all the necessary files, as well as an executable file, for generating unitary tests for the operations of a model that has been developed using CordisModeler tool. These tests can then be launched on the robot corresponding to the model developed. The folder also includes an user manual and a video example explaining how to create and deploy tests using the CordisModeler export file as an input.
